For the Arduino, tested on Arduino UNO

inspiration from light theremin in the Arduino library

Read analog input to blink a led randomly
blink faster as finger is closer to the LDR
connected to analog input SEED
constants MIN and MAX determine the duration of each blink

# hardware

You will need a LED connected to the output, or use the built in LED on the Arduino

You will need some sort of voltage divider connected to the analog input

I used an LDR so the LED blinks faster as the finger approaches the LDR

happy hacking!
